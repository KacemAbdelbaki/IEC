\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my academic supervisor, \textbf{Mr. Denis Pallez} (Associate Professor at Université Côte d'Azur, I3S Laboratory), for his invaluable guidance, availability, and the trust he placed in me throughout this research project. His expertise in Evolutionary Computation was instrumental in shaping the methodology of this work.

I am grateful to the entire team at the \textbf{I3S Laboratory} (Laboratoire d'Informatique, Signaux et Systèmes de Sophia Antipolis) for providing a stimulating research environment and the necessary hardware resources (Tobii Pro Nano) to conduct these experiments.

Finally, I wish to thank my family and friends for their constant motivation and support during this internship.
